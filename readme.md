# Backup Scripts and Automations for Bitwarden Password Vaults

> It's important to note that where Bitwarden tools are used to export data, specific limitations may apply, for example the backup of item attachments. Please ensure you review all the tools used to fully understand these limitations.

The purpose of this repository is to give you some examples and ideas on how you can achieve Bitwarden Password Manager Vault backups using the various tools and technologies available. 

The examples in this repository are designed to give you a starting point to develop your own backup solutions. These scripts and automations are not officially supported by Bitwarden and therefore please adapt and understand how these work. Bitwarden takes no responsibility for how these scripts are used and the security of the data extracted as part of their running. 

These scripts are also not actively maintained, however if you do have a specific issue then please feel free to log an issue or submit a PR.
